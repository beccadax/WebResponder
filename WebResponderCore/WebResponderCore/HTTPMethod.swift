/// Represents an HTTP method in a safe, bug-resistant manner. RFC 7231 
/// specifies that HTTP methods are case-sensitive, allow ASCII alphanumeric 
/// characters and certain punctuation marks, and can be extended arbitrarily. 
/// `HTTPMethod` is designed to support these traits.
/// 
/// `HTTPMethod` includes constants for all RFC 7231 methods, plus the `PATCH` 
/// method, which is drawn from WebDAV but is used by some web frameworks. For 
/// information on adding support for other methods, see the documentation on the 
/// `registerMethod(_:)` method.
/// 
/// - Note: If you know the method you intend to use when you're writing your code, 
///   use the corresponding static constant on `HTTPMethod` to refer to it, 
///   such as `.GET` or `.POST`. If you're creating an `HTTPMethod` from data 
///   acquired at runtime, use the `init(rawValue:)` initializer, which returns 
///   `nil` if the method is invalid or not registered.
