/// object contains the data that will be sent with the response, including its 
/// status, headers, and body. Though WebResponderCore includes a 
/// `SimpleHTTPResponse`, most server adapters will want to implement their own 
/// class conforming to this protocol.
/// 
/// Middleware may want to wrap responses in a response type of their own which 
/// adds additional data or alters existing data. Such wrapping responses should 
/// conform to `LayeredHTTPResponseType`, which has been extended with logic to 
/// make this easy.

/// properties or methods they expose should be declared as extensions on 
/// `HTTPResponseType`; these extensions should use `responseOfType(_:)` to locate

/// extension methods should account for the possibility that they're being called on 
/// a response which hasn't passed through the middleware in question, and so 
/// `responseOfType(_:)` will return `nil`.

/// See `RequestIDMiddleware` for an example of this in action with the `request`
/// object; `response` would be similar.
