/// Represents the response that will be sent to the request. An `HTTPResponseType` 
/// object contains the data that will be sent with the response, including its 
/// status, headers, and body. It also is used to signal to the server that a 
/// response is complete and should be sent, through the `respond()` method, or 
/// that an error occurred, through the `failWithError(_:)` method. Though 
/// WebResponderCore includes a closure-based `SimpleHTTPResponse`, most server 
/// adapters will want to implement their own class conforming to this protocol.
/// 
/// Middleware may want to wrap responses in a response type of their own which 
/// adds additional data, alters existing data, includes additional 
/// response-processing logic in `respond()`, or handles or translates errors 
/// signaled through `failWithError(_:)`. Such wrapping responses should conform 
/// to `LayeredHTTPResponseType`, which has been extended with logic to make this 
/// easy.

/// response-related services to responders further up the responder chain.
/// 
/// Typically, a `LayeredHTTPResponseType` should be private. Any additional 
/// properties or methods they expose should be declared as extensions on 
/// `HTTPResponseType`; these extensions should use `responseOfType(_:)` to locate 
/// your private HTTP response type and access the needed services with it. Any such 
/// extension methods should account for the possibility that they're being called on 
/// a response which hasn't passed through the middleware in question, and so 
/// `responseOfType(_:)` will return `nil`.
