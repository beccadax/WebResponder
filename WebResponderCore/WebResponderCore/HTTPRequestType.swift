/// request type conform to this protocol, rather than copying data from their 
/// server's request into a `SimpleHTTPRequest`.

/// additional data or alters existing data. Such wrapping requests should conform 
/// to `LayeredHTTPRequestType`, which has been extended with logic to make this 
/// easy.

/// extension methods should account for the possibility that they're being called on 
/// a request which hasn't passed through the middleware in question, and so
