WebResponderCore
=============

(If you haven't read the README for the WebResponder project, go back and do that 
thing. It's in this folder's parent directory.)

WebResponderCore contains the core types for WebResponder:

* `HTTPRequestType` and `HTTPResponseType`: These types encapsulate the contents 
   of HTTP requests and responses, respectively.
* `HTTPMethod` and `HTTPStatus`: represent request methods and response statuses,
   including a large number of constants covering standard values for them.
* `HTTPBodyType`: Contains the contents of a request's or response's body. Each 
  `HTTPBodyType` can be read only once, and can be read lazily.
* `WebResponderType`: The fundamental type for a responder, an object that 
   participates in the handling of requests. `WebResponderType` is based on 
   two other protocols: `WebResponderChainable` and 
   `WebResponderRespondable`.
* `WebRequestable`, `WebMiddlewareType`, and `WebResponderChain`: Types for 
  forming chains of middleware providing services to a final responder.
* `SimpleHTTPRequest`, `SimpleHTTPResponse`, `SimpleWebResponder`, and 
  `SimpleWebMiddleware`: Basic, usually block-based implementations of these 
  protocols, useful for testing or quick-and-dirty implementations.
* `RequestIDMiddleware`: Generates a unique UUID for each incoming request.
* `CoreVersionResponder`: Displays WebResponder version information.
* `UnicodeEncoder` and `UnicodeDecoder`: Lazily converts between streams of 
  Unicode bytes and Swift `UnicodeScalar`s.
* `Latin1`: A `UnicodeCodecType` for ISO-8859-1, to match the Swift standard 
  library's `UTF8`, `UTF16`, and `UTF32` types.

Each of these types includes documentation comments, so I won't waste time 
recapitulating all the gory details. Instead, I'll discuss some high-level 
conceptual things here.

Responders
--------

Any object that helps process a request is a responder and conforms to the 
`WebResponderType` protocol. This protocol requires that you implement one method:

    func respond(response: HTTPResponseType, toRequest request: HTTPRequestType)

In this method, `request` is an input, while `response` is essentially an output. 
You read information from `request` to determine what to do, and then write to 
`response` to send information back to the client.

Once you've finished, you can basically do three things: 

1. Tell the `response` to begin sending itself by calling its `respond()` method.
2. Signal that an error occurred while processing the request by calling the 
    `response`'s `failWithError(_:)` method.
3. Forward the request and response to another responder to do additional
    processing. If your responder does this in a simple linear way, it should be a 
    middleware, conforming to `WebMiddlewareType` and forwarding the request 
    through the `sendRequestToNextResponder(_:response:)` method.

The response is not sent until `respond()` or `failWithError(_:)` is called, so 
a responder can hold onto the request and response while it performs asynchronous 
calls and use them later.

A middleware's `respond(_:toRequest:)` method runs before the final responder's, 
so if a middleware wants to insert logic that's performed *after* it, it will need 
to wrap the `response` passed to its next responder in a custom type with a 
different implementation of `respond()`. Middleware may also replace the `request` 
or `response` with a custom type to make additional data or functionality 
accessible to responders later in the responder chain.

The `WebResponderChain` class manages a series of middleware terminating in a 
final responder, making it more convenient to build up and manipulate such a 
structure.
