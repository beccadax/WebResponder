WebResponderCore
=============

(If you haven't read the README for the WebResponder project, go back and do that 
thing. It's in this folder's parent directory.)

WebResponderCore contains the core types for WebResponder:

* `HTTPRequestType` and `HTTPResponseType`: These types encapsulate the contents 
   of HTTP requests and responses, respectively.
* `HTTPMethod` and `HTTPStatus`: represent request methods and response statuses,
   including a large number of constants covering standard values for them.
* `HTTPBodyType`: Contains the contents of a request's or response's body. Each 
  `HTTPBodyType` can be read only once, and can be read lazily.
* `WebResponderType`: The fundamental type for a responder, an object that 
   participates in the handling of requests. `WebResponderType` is based on 
   two other protocols: `WebResponderChainable` and 
   `WebResponderRespondable`.
* `SimpleHTTPRequest`, `SimpleHTTPResponse`, and `SimpleWebResponder`: Basic, 
   sometimes block-based implementations of these protocols, useful for testing or 
   quick-and-dirty implementations.
* `RequestIDHelper`: Generates a unique UUID for each incoming request.
* `CoreVersionResponder`: Displays WebResponder version information.
* `UnicodeEncoder` and `UnicodeDecoder`: Lazily converts between streams of 
  Unicode bytes and Swift `UnicodeScalar`s.
* `Latin1`: A `UnicodeCodecType` for ISO-8859-1, to match the Swift standard 
  library's `UTF8`, `UTF16`, and `UTF32` types.

Each of these types includes documentation comments, so I won't waste time 
recapitulating all the gory details. Instead, I'll discuss some high-level 
conceptual things here.

Responders
--------

Any object that helps process a request is a responder and conforms to the 
`WebResponderType` protocol. This protocol requires that you implement two methods:

    func respond(response: HTTPResponseType, toRequest request: HTTPRequestType)

A variant of this method adds a `withError:` parameter, indicating that an error 
has occurred.

In this method, `request` is an input, while `response` is essentially an output. 
You read information from `request` to determine what to do, and then write to 
`response` to send information back to the client.

Once you've finished, you call either `respond(_:toRequest:)` on your 
`nextResponder` to continue processing normally, or 
`respond(_:withError:toRequest:)` if processing failed. WebResponder is intended to
support asynchronous processing, so you can delay passing a response to the 
`nextResponder` until after you've returned.

You can directly set `nextResponder` to set up the responder chain, but unless 
you're initializing an object, you'll usually want to insert it between two existing
responders. The `insertNextResponder(_:)` method does that thing.

Helper Responders
-------------

A responder can specify "helper responders" which should be inserted before it in 
the responder chain. To do this, it should override the `helperResponders()` method 
to return an array of such responders. Calling `withHelperResponders()` on a 
responder will connect all of the helper responders to the original responder and 
return the first of them.

A helper responder is always inserted before the responder that requested it, but 
sometimes you want to add processing *after* the responder you're helping. You 
can do that by setting a `nextResponder` immediately in your initializer; then the 
responder you're helping will be inserted between the two.
